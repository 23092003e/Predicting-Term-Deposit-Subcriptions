# Predicting-Term-Deposit-Suscriptions
Predicting term deposit subscriptions is a common classification problem in the banking sector. It involves predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features. Here's a general overview and breakdown of relevant features and methods for predicting term deposit subscriptions

## Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and standardize the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identify and select the most important features that influence term deposit subscriptions.
- **Model Training:** Implement classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc., to build predictive models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compare model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Dataset & Background
The dataset primarily comes from a bank's marketing campaigns and includes customer demographics, transaction history, and campaign-related features. The objective is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.
